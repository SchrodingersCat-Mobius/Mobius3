title: "Looper X Emulation"
---

I'm posting some notes about my initial attempts to "emulate" the Sheeran Looper X within MÃ¶bius.  I don't actually own of those, but the User Manual is available online at <https://cdn.inmusicbrands.com/sheeran/looper-x/Sheeran%20Looper%20X%20-%20User%20Guide%20-%20v1.0.0.pdf> and I've been using that to understand how it operates.
