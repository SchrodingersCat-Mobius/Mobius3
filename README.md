# Möbius3

Repository for all my things Möbius.

The repository is used to manage a Github-Pages site located at <https://schrodingerscat-mobius.github.io/Mobius3/>

The website is contained within the `docs` folder which is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

Website configuration is defined inside `_quarto.yml`.

Content is contained in any Quarto markdown files `*.qmd` (in the root or subdirectories of this repository).

While editing in a clone of the repository on a local computer a preview of the website can be obtained using the shell command:

```
# To render and preview the website in the current directory
quarto preview 
```
