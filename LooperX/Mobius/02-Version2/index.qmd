title: Advanced Version
---  

This version extends the Basic Version to add some of the Looper X behaviour associated with [Function Menu A](/LooperX/#function-menu-a) and [Function Menu B](/LooperX/#function-menu-b):

* Pedals 1-4 work as expected when in [Normal Mode](/LooperX/#normal-mode) or [Mute Mode](/LooperX/#mute-mode)
* Pedal 5 works as expected when in [Normal Mode](/LooperX/#normal-mode), [Mute Mode](/LooperX/#mute-mode) or [Tap Tempo](/LooperX#tap-tempo)
* Pedal 6 works as expected when in [Normal Mode](/LooperX/#normal-mode)
* Pedal 7 works as expected when in [Normal Mode](/LooperX/#normal-mode) or [Mute Mode](/LooperX/#mute-mode)
* Pedal 8 works as expected when in [Normal Mode](/LooperX/#normal-mode) and can be used to switch between [Function Menu A](/LooperX/#function-menu-a) and [Function Menu B](/LooperX/#function-menu-b)

After entering [Function Menu A](/LooperX/#function-menu-a)

* Pressing Pedal 5 enables "Peel Mode". Pedals 1–4 can then be used to permanently "peel off" the successive layers of the corresponding looper track.
* Pressing Pedal 6 clears all tracks.
* Pressing Pedal 7 enables "Clear Track Mode". Pedals 1–4 can then be used to clear individual tracks.
* Pressing Pedal 8 exits Function Menu A.
* Tuner, FX, Load and Save functionality is not implemented.

After entering [Function Menu B](/LooperX/#function-menu-b):

* Pressing Pedal 2 enters "Multiply Mode". Pedals 1-4 can then be used to multiply the length of the active track by 0.5X, 2X, 4X and 8X respectively.
* Pressing Pedal 3 enters "Speed Mode". Pedals 1-4 can then be used multiply the speed (and pitch) of the active track by 0.5X, 2X, 4X and 8X respectively.
* Pressing Pedal 7 enters "Reverse Mode" Pedals 1-4 can then be used to toggle the play direction of Track 1-4. Pedal 5 reverses the play direction of all tracks.
* Pressing Pedal 8 exits Function Menu B.
* Bounce, Backing Track, Transpose and Fade functionality is not implemented.

Below are some images of how the implementation looks in Möbius. (Click on any image to enlarge it.)
