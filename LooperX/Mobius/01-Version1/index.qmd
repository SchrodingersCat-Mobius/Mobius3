title: Basic Version
---  

This version implements the following aspects of Looper X behaviour:

* Pedals 1-4 work as expected when in [Normal Mode](/LooperX/#normal-mode) or [Mute Mode](/LooperX/#mute-mode)
* Pedal 5 works as expected when in [Normal Mode](/LooperX/#normal-mode), [Mute Mode](/LooperX/#mute-mode) or [Tap Tempo](/LooperX#tap-tempo)
* Pedal 6 works as expected when in [Normal Mode](/LooperX/#normal-mode)
* Pedal 7 works as expected when in [Normal Mode](/LooperX/#normal-mode) or [Mute Mode](/LooperX/#mute-mode)
* Pedal 8 works as expected when in [Normal Mode](/LooperX/#normal-mode) and can be used to switch between [Function Menu A](/LooperX/#function-menu-a) and [Function Menu B](/LooperX/#function-menu-b)


This is achieved by a set of nine msl scripts (one UI Widget Library script, and eight individual pedal scripts.) 

Below are some images of how the implementation looks in MÃ¶bius. (Click on any image to enlarge it.)
